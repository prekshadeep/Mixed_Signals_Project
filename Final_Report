Abstract - This work presents a low-power, high-speed dynamic comparator featuring a transconductance-enhanced latching stage for analog-to-digital converter (ADC) applications. Unlike conventional 
cross-coupled inverters, the proposed latch biases all transistors in strong inversion during the reset phase, significantly improving effective transconductance at the start of comparison. This 
enhancement shortens regeneration time, reduces metastability, and lowers energy consumption. Designed in 180-nm CMOS and operating at a 1.2 V supply, the comparator achieves up to 2 GS/s sampling 
speed with only 110 fJ per comparison. Simulation and measurement results confirm reduced delay, low power consumption, and compact area compared to conventional designs, making it suitable for 
high-performance, low-voltage ADCs.
